### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive exploration)
- Required Python libraries: 
  - scikit-learn
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - any other libraries specific to your ensemble learning techniques

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
 https://github.com/Vsiddarth
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd roc-registration-trends
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. Start a Jupyter Notebook or use your preferred Python IDE.

2. Open and run the `Exploration_and_Prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to explore and run the code.

### Data Collection
Before running the code, you should have the necessary RoC data. You can collect this data from the RoC's official website or any other reliable source. Ensure that the data is in a suitable format (e.g., CSV) and store it in the `data/` directory.
Data source: https://tn.data.gov.in/resource/company-master-data-tamil-nadu-upto-28th-february-2019

### Data Preprocessing
In the Jupyter Notebook, you will find sections for data preprocessing. This may include cleaning, feature engineering, and data splitting. Modify these sections as needed for your specific dataset.

### Model Training
Train ensemble learning models by following the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook. You can experiment with different ensemble techniques like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost based on your specific project requirements.

### Evaluation
Evaluate your models using appropriate metrics and visualizations. The Jupyter Notebook will guide you through this process.

### Contributing
If you wish to contribute to this project, please fork the repository, create a branch for your work, and submit a pull request with your changes.

This project focuses on utilizing ensemble learning techniques to explore and predict company registration trends using data from the Registrar of Companies (RoC).

### Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from the Registrar of Companies (RoC). The RoC is the official body responsible for registering companies within a specific jurisdiction. This dataset contains essential information about registered companies, including registration dates, business types, geographical locations, and financial details. The RoC provides this data for public access and research purposes. It's important to ensure that you have the necessary permissions and comply with data usage regulations when collecting and using RoC data.

### Project Description
This project's primary objectives are as follows:

- Explore historical company registration patterns and trends based on RoC data.
- Predict future company registration trends to aid in decision-making and planning.
- Leverage ensemble learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy of these predictions.
- Visualize and interpret the results to provide actionable insights into company registration trends.

The project can be broken down into the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain the RoC data from official sources, ensuring that it's in an appropriate format (e.g., CSV) and store it in the `data/` directory.
Data source: https://tn.data.gov.in/resource/company-master-data-tamil-nadu-upto-28th-february-2019

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare and clean the data for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, feature engineering, and data splitting.

3. **Model Training**: Train ensemble learning models, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost, using the preprocessed data.

4. **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the trained models using suitable metrics and create visualizations to aid in understanding the results.

The project aims to provide a robust and data-driven approach to understanding and predicting company registration trends, which can be valuable for businesses, policymakers, and researchers.

Feel free to customize this README file according to your project's specific details and requirements. Good luck with your AI-driven exploration and prediction of company registration trends with RoC.
